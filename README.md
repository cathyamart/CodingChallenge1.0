This is a Sign Up and Login form developed with LinkedIn API.
In this application, the user signs in by loading up his or her credentials like;
First and last name, email, password, etc. and its recorded in the database.
If the user is already a registered user, he or she logs in directly to LinkedIn with his email and password.

Thank you
